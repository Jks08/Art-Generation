# Art-Generation
This project was built to generate 1 single piece of art(picture) by merging components from 2 input images.
It makes use of Neural Style Transfer.

**Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.**
